# Note-Detector
This is the DSP (Digital Signal Processing) project that me and my friends have made. This project basically detects the frequency and prints out the corresponding Note value for each seconds of given track.  
Note values are evaluated based on frequencies in MIDI chart.  Track needs to be on wav format!
